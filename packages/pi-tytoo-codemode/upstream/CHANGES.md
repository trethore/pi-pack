# Local changes from upstream

Intentional local changes to preserve when updating from upstream.

## Render

- Remove the `codemode` header from call rendering so the code starts on the first line in both collapsed and expanded views.
- Format user-facing JSON results as indented objects and lists with triple-quoted multiline strings, without changing model-facing output.

## Configuration

- Add `pi-tytoo-codemode.jsonc` through the shared configuration loader. `prettyResults` defaults to `true`; set it to `false` to keep raw JSON rendering.
- Load configuration on session start. A trusted project file at `.pi/pi-tytoo-codemode.jsonc` takes precedence over the global file in the Pi agent directory.
